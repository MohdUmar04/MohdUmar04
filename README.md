<h3>My name is Mohd. Umar</h3> 
<p align="justify">

I'm proficient in multiple languages including Java, Python, and Kotlin, and have a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. My technical skills are complemented by my achievements, including qualifying for the prestigious Amazon ML Summer School and securing top ranks in competitive coding and hackathons.

As an author and researcher, I have contributed to international publications, and I am always eager to learn and grow in the dynamic field of technology. When I'm not coding, you can find me enhancing my skills in graphic design and video editing or solving challenges on top coding platforms. Feel free to connect with me on GitHub and LinkedIn to collaborate on exciting projects or just to have a tech [chat!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohd-umar04/)
